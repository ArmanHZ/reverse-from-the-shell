* Reverse from the Shell (rvfs)
This is a TUI implementation of [[https://github.com/0dayCTF/reverse-shell-generator][0dayCTF's]] reverse shell generator.

The TUI library used for this project is [[https://github.com/rivo/tview][tview]].

I decided to work on this project because I wanted a quick and easy way to generate listeners and payloads when doing CTFs/HTB from the comfort of my Terminal environment.

* ⚠️ Attention ⚠️
I made this repo public when ~rvfs~ reached the minimal working version status.

As of now, some features from 0dayCTF's website are missing.

These features are filtering of payloads and any other type of shell other than
reverse shell. I will be implementing bind shell and the rest in the future.

* Build and Run

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Build
go build -o bin/ ./cmd/rvfs/

# Run
./bin/rvfs
#+END_SRC

** Color bug
~tview~ uses [[https://github.com/gdamore/tcell][tcell]] under the hood. So, all the colors are managed by that library (afaik). ~tcell~ respects your terminal colors and theme, but some colors might be unreadable
in the context of a ~tview~ application.

If you encounter such colors, I implemented a temporary fix.

You can use the following flag:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Color fix
rvfs -color-fix
#+END_SRC

* Usage
- You can navigate (change focus) between the components using =tab= and =shift+tab=
- Use =Enter= to interact with the buttons and dropdown menus
- When focused on the payload table, you can go up and down using the arrow keys, or the =Vim= keys.

This is how ~rvfs~ looks like with the default Kali theme/colors:

#+CAPTION: Earliest working version of rvfs
#+NAME: rvfs 0.1
[[./img/rvfs-0.1.png]]

* Current features
- All listeners are available
- All the reverse shell payloads (except P0wny Shell, which will be added later)) are available
- ~rvfs~ utilizes [[https://github.com/golang-design/clipboard][design clipboard]], so you can use the =copy= buttons to copy the payloads to your clipboard
    - If you press enter while your focus is on the shell table, it also copies the payload to your clipboard
