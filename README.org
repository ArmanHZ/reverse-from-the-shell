* Reverse from the Shell (rvfs)
This is a TUI implementation of [[https://github.com/0dayCTF/reverse-shell-generator][0dayCTF's]] reverse shell generator.

* ⚠️ Attention ⚠️
I made this repo public when ~rvfs~ reached the minimal working version status.

As of now, some features from 0dayCTF's website are missing.

These features are filtering of payloads and any other type of shell other than
reverse shell. I will be implementing bind shell and the rest in the future.

* Build and Run

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Build
go build -o bin/ ./cmd/rvfs/

# Run
./bin/rvfs

# If you encounter color related problems, try this
./bin/rvfs -color-fix
#+END_SRC

* Usage
- You can navigate (change focus) between the components using =tab= and =shift+tab=
- Use =Enter= to interact with the buttons and dropdown menus
- When focused on the payload table, you can go up and down using the arrow keys,
or the =Vim= keys.

#+CAPTION: Earliest working version of rvfs
#+NAME: rvfs 0.1

* Current features
- All listeners are available
- All the reverse shell payloads (except P0wny Shell, which will be added later)) are available
- ~rvfs~ utilizes [[https://github.com/golang-design/clipboard][design clipboard]],
so you can use the =copy= buttons to copy the payloads to your clipboard
    - If you press enter while your focus is on the shell table, it also copies
    the payload to your clipboard
